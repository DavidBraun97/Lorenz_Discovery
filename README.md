# Discovery of governing equations from data using MATLAB

I have created this project within the scope of a series of educational projects for fellow students at TUM.
The main objective of this project is to arouse interest, both in physics informed ML and in coding in general.

## How to run the application:
Open main.mlx in MATLAB and run the script.
